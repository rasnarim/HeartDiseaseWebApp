    <h2>Explanations of Parameters</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>ST Depression Exercise:</strong> Measures the depression in the ST segment of an electrocardiogram (ECG) during exercise. The ST segment represents the interval between the depolarization and repolarization of heart ventricles. Abnormalities in this segment can indicate issues such as ischemia or reduced blood flow to the heart. <br>
        <em>Example:</em> A value of 0.4 suggests mild stress, while values over 2.0 may indicate significant abnormality.</li>

        <li><strong>Maximum Heart Rate:</strong> The highest heart rate achieved during exercise, measured in beats per minute (bpm). It reflects cardiovascular fitness and response to physical exertion. <br>
        <em>Example:</em> A value of 150 bpm is common during moderate exercise, while a very low maximum HR could indicate underlying issues.</li>

        <li><strong>Number of Vessels Involved:</strong> Indicates how many major blood vessels are narrowed or blocked, based on diagnostic tests (e.g., angiograms). <br>
        <em>Example:</em> A value of 0.0 suggests no blockage, while 3.0 indicates significant arterial involvement.</li>

        <li><strong>Age:</strong> The patientâ€™s age in years, which is a key factor in assessing heart disease risk. Older age generally increases risk. <br>
        <em>Example:</em> A 57-year-old patient is at moderate risk, while younger individuals may have lower risk unless other factors are present.</li>

        <li><strong>Resting Blood Pressure:</strong> The blood pressure measured when the patient is at rest, expressed in millimeters of mercury (mmHg). High values indicate hypertension, which increases cardiovascular risk. <br>
        <em>Example:</em> A value of 128 mmHg is slightly elevated but still considered near-normal, while values above 140 mmHg suggest hypertension.</li>
    </ul>
